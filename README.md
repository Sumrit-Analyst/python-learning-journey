# Python Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of scripts and projects created while completing the Microsoft Python Development Certificate on Coursera. The goal is to document my progress and demonstrate my ability to apply Python logic to real-world scenarios in trading and data analysis.

## Projects

1. Trade Readiness Checker (trade_readiness_checker.py)
A decision-making tool that evaluates whether a trader is financially and psychologically prepared for a trade.

## Features:
- Validates account balance against minimum requirements.
- Uses string methods, .lower() to handle varied user input for discipline checks.
- Calculates total risk amount using a fixed risk percentage (1%).
- Provides formatted output using f-strings for clear reporting.

## Roadmap
- Module 1: Python Foundations (Completed)
- Module 2: Basic Logic and Decisions (Completed)
- Next: Implementing Loops for Financial Planning
